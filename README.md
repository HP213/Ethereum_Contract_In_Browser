# Ethereum_Contract_In_Browser

So Guys most of us made contract in Solidity for Ethereum Blockchain, but sometimes it becomes difficult to show it on web page as a local host... 
So we can do it easily with react.js

Firstly let me tell you that the project we are here going to use is deployed already, you can see it here : https://github.com/HP213/Ethereum_Lottery_Contract
Follow the steps in above repository to deploy your contract.

Now download this repository and open it and open lottery.js
Add address to which your contract is deployed which is deployed above. Address will be shown in terminal while deploying.
Similarly your ABI key from there, it will look like this:-

Now open terminal and run **npm run start**

And wait for some seconds and your browser will automatically run on localhost:3000

Note : Requirement of Metamask is must
